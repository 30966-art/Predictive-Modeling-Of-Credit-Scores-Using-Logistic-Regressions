# Predictive-Modeling-Of-Credit-Scores-Using-Logistic-Regressions
## Objective



To build a fast, cost-effective, and explainable machine learning model for predicting credit scores in real-time financial applications.

## Technologies Used

Python 3

Apache Spark (PySpark)

Spark MLlib

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset contains financial attributes:

Income

Loan Amount

Repayment History

Credit Utilization

Credit Score (Target Variable)

## Approach

Data loading and preprocessing using PySpark

Feature engineering with VectorAssembler

Logistic Regression model training

Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC

Model deployment and inference on new data

## Results

The model provides probabilistic credit score predictions with a focus on interpretability. Feature coefficients help explain the impact of financial parameters on creditworthiness.
